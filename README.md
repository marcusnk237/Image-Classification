# Tumor-Classification

This program allows a supervised classification of different types of tumors.
First, we will load the data (the folders containing the data must be named according to the type of tumor).
The program will then extract the folder names, and create classes from these names.

We create and train a convolutional neural network, so that it can recognize the type (class) of tumor.
